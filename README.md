# Supplementary Materials to *The Self-Destructing Text: Hermann Broch's "Der Tod des Vergil" and the Limits of Avant-Garde Narrative*
## Dissertation for the Graduate School at the Pennsylvania State University by Jake van der Kolk, Ph.D.

My dissertation, which I defended in August 2017, shows how Hermann Broch's novel *Der Tod des Vergil* (1945) deliberately frustrates reading in order to critique the avant-garde from within. It includes a significant digital humanities component relating to two aspects:
1. ***Erzählzeit/erzählte Zeit*** **Density.** Here, I compared how long Broch's inner monologue (i.e. stream-of-consciousness) novel would take to read in relation to the amount of time it depicts, providing a "number of words per hour depicted" ration. This number was compared to that of other inner monologue texts to demonstrate *Tod des Vergil*'s relative density.
2. **Associative Meanings.** I argue that words in *Tod des Vergil* do not have fixed meanings, but rather signify according to non-semantic associations, most notably other words that appear in close proximity. Correspondingly, I measured out the meanings of specific terms by plotting out the terms that appear near them the most disproportionately.

My dissertation will soon be available through the [Penn State Graduate Thesis Database](https://etda.libraries.psu.edu/catalog) and later in other to-be-determined publications.

In this repository, you can find additional materials used in my dissertation, including:

- A digitized copy of Hermann Broch's *Der Tod des Vergil* (1945) under the `raw-text` folder.
- Working textual manipulation scripts used in the quantitative analysis of Broch's text under the `scripts` folder.
- The resulting statistical breakdowns of the above text in the `statistics` folder.

Each folder provides further descriptions of their contents.
